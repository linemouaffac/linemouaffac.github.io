about_content: |
  I am a physics PhD student at the [Institute of Mineralogy, Physics of Materials, and Cosmochemistry (IMPMC)](https://impmc.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html) at Sorbonne University since 2022, under the supervision of [Fabio Pietrucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0fu5X-cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

  My main area of research lies at the interface of computational chemistry, statistical physics, and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in finding optimal reaction coordinates (RC) to model rare events. The rare events at stake are physico-chemical transformations such as nucleation, dissociation of complexes in water, and protein-protein interactions. My goal is to retrieve free energy surfaces (FES) and kinetic rates from molecular dynamics trajectories. The accuracy of the model depends on the judicious choice of the reaction coordinates. Building upon a recent variational theorem, I developped a method that systematically minimizes the kinetic rate to obtain optimal RCs. This method serves as a viable replacement for committor-based methods with substantially lower computational costs.

  Here is my [resume](./files/cv.pdf).
